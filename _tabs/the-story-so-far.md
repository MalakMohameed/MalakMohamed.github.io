# About Me

## Welcome!
Hey there! It seems you're interested in getting to know me, aren't you?

I'm Malak Mohamed, a computer science student from Egypt, and I'm currently wrapping up my last year of studies. I have a passion for artificial intelligence, competitive programming, and open-source contributions. But I'm also a bit of a nerd, and I really love cats! When I'm not immersed in tech, I enjoy playing chess, watching movies, diving into philosophy, and, of course, reading and writing.

## Why I Started This Blog
I started this blog because I love documenting my journey and sharing my thoughts. Writing helps me understand myself better and allows me to reflect on my ideas and feelings. Plus, Iâ€™ll be posting a lot about my work in the world of AI and other tech-related topics! 

Writing, for me, is a way to express whatâ€™s inside, and through this blog, I hope to connect with others, share my learning experiences, and grow along the way.

## Life
Life has always seemed pretty simple to me, but as we go through it, we tend to complicate things. Iâ€™m trying to keep things as simple as possible. Life is short, so if you encounter toxic people or negative influences, donâ€™t hesitate to cut them outâ€”same goes if I'm toxic to you. I find joy in lifeâ€™s unpredictability and absurdity, and I don't take things too seriously. Every day, I strive to be a better version of myself, not just for me, but for the people who matter to me.

## People
I believe we can learn from everyone, even those we may least expect. I have a knack for identifying authenticity in others and avoiding the fake ones. Iâ€™m not here to please anyone, even my friendsâ€”I prefer to be genuine. Thatâ€™s how I build meaningful relationships. I value people who mirror the truth and encourage growth. If you're someone who helps me become a better version of myself, Iâ€™m all for it. 

## Goal
My goal is simple: to learn as much as I can and share that knowledge with others. I believe learning is an ongoing journey, and Iâ€™m determined to keep growing, both personally and professionally.

## Are you a serial killer?
Just kidding! Letâ€™s keep things light, shall we? ðŸ˜„
