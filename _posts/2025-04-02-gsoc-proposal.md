# Google Summer of Code 2025 Proposal

## Project: Synchronized Multi-Camera Video Recording in OpenCV

### Mentor:
**Alexander S.** (OpenCV Community)

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to implement synchronized multi-camera video recording using OpenCV, enabling real-time capture of video streams from multiple cameras in a synchronized manner. This is especially valuable for applications in multi-view scenarios where calibration between different cameras and synchronization of the video streams are crucial. The project will focus on working with various camera input methods, including V4L2 and RTSP streams, and ensuring that video frames from multiple cameras are timestamped and captured synchronously.

I’m Malak Mohamed, an AI student at Misr International University, Egypt, with a passion for computer vision and machine learning. Over the past few years, I have focused on using OpenCV for various computer vision tasks, including image processing, object detection, and video analysis. I’ve also worked extensively with C++ for performance-sensitive applications, allowing me to understand the underlying mechanics of video capture and synchronization.

I have contributed to several projects involving image and video processing, and I am excited to take on a challenge that involves multi-camera setups. I see this Google Summer of Code (GSoC) opportunity as a perfect way to apply my skills and further deepen my expertise in OpenCV while contributing to open-source development.

### Investigations:
- **Set Up OpenCV Environment:** I’ve already set up OpenCV with C++ in my development environment and have been working on video processing tasks using `cv::VideoCapture` and `cv::VideoWriter`.
- **Multi-Camera Setup:** I have explored OpenCV's support for multi-camera setups and how to handle them in synchronous scenarios. I have also tested various camera sources, including V4L2, and RTSP streams.
- **Initial Testing:** I’ve tested basic video capture and playback functions, which will be crucial for setting up synchronized recording. I am currently reviewing OpenCV’s capabilities with timestamped video frames.

## Problem Understanding

In multi-camera video recording, especially in applications requiring calibration and synchronization, there is often a need to ensure that the video streams from all cameras are captured simultaneously, or as close to simultaneously as possible. This is especially important in scenarios such as 3D reconstruction, motion capture, or when combining video data from multiple perspectives. OpenCV provides strong tools for working with video feeds, but synchronizing multiple feeds and handling timestamps across different sources is a complex task.

The **Synchronized Multi-Camera Video Recording** project aims to overcome these challenges by ensuring that video recordings from multiple cameras, whether they use V4L2, RTSP, or other input methods, are captured with accurate timestamps, enabling proper alignment of the video streams. This will involve adjusting `cv::VideoCapture` and `cv::VideoWriter` and potentially extending OpenCV’s capabilities to meet the synchronization requirements.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Synchronized Video Recording:**  
The primary deliverable will be a sample implementation for synchronized multi-camera video recording. The solution will synchronize video streams from multiple cameras (e.g., V4L2, RTSP) and ensure they are captured with accurate timestamps.

- **Timestamping:**  
The video frames captured by all cameras will be timestamped accurately, ensuring that the videos can be aligned for further processing or analysis.

- **Extending OpenCV Functionality:**  
If necessary, I will extend OpenCV’s existing functionality to improve multi-camera synchronization, handling different input types and providing the necessary synchronization logic.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
I will document the project thoroughly, providing clear setup instructions, usage examples, and explanations of the core synchronization logic for future developers.
