# Google Summer of Code 2025 Proposal

## Project: Synchronized Multi-Camera Video Recording in OpenCV

### Mentor:
**Alexander S.** (OpenCV Community)

### Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to implement synchronized multi-camera video recording using OpenCV, enabling the real-time capture of video streams from multiple cameras in a synchronized manner. This feature will be particularly valuable in applications that require multiple viewpoints, such as surveillance, 3D modeling, or event recording. 

The project aims to ensure the precise synchronization of video streams from different camera sources, including V4L2 and RTSP streams. It will involve developing mechanisms to handle timestamping, ensuring that frames from each camera are captured simultaneously. Additionally, the project will address challenges related to video frame calibration across different cameras, ensuring that the multiple video streams align perfectly for further analysis or playback.

This feature is designed to provide a reliable and efficient solution for capturing synchronized multi-camera video, which can be used in various domains such as research, entertainment, and security systems. By leveraging OpenCV, the project will ensure that the solution is highly customizable, scalable, and easy to integrate with other systems or applications.

## Problem Understanding

In multi-camera video recording, especially in applications requiring calibration and synchronization, there is often a need to ensure that the video streams from all cameras are captured simultaneously, or as close to simultaneously as possible. This is especially important in scenarios such as 3D reconstruction, motion capture, or when combining video data from multiple perspectives. OpenCV provides strong tools for working with video feeds, but synchronizing multiple feeds and handling timestamps across different sources is a complex task.

The **Synchronized Multi-Camera Video Recording** project aims to overcome these challenges by ensuring that video recordings from multiple cameras, whether they use V4L2, RTSP, or other input methods, are captured with accurate timestamps, enabling proper alignment of the video streams. This will involve adjusting `cv::VideoCapture` and `cv::VideoWriter` and potentially extending OpenCV’s capabilities to meet the synchronization requirements.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Synchronized Video Recording:**  
The primary deliverable will be a sample implementation for synchronized multi-camera video recording. The solution will synchronize video streams from multiple cameras (e.g., V4L2, RTSP) and ensure they are captured with accurate timestamps.

- **Timestamping:**  
The video frames captured by all cameras will be timestamped accurately, ensuring that the videos can be aligned for further processing or analysis.

- **Extending OpenCV Functionality:**  
If necessary, I will extend OpenCV’s existing functionality to improve multi-camera synchronization, handling different input types and providing the necessary synchronization logic.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
I will document the project thoroughly, providing clear setup instructions, usage examples, and explanations of the core synchronization logic for future developers.
